# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
(fill in your description and goals here)
Focused on the learning that we have acheived throughout our time in the Data Science Flex course, this project brings together and tests SQL knowledge.


## Process
### Loaded CSV data into pgAdmin
- 5 unique CSV files had to be manually loaded into pgadmin
- loaded each column as text to avoid issues with data discrepancies 
### (your step 2)

## Results
(fill in what you discovered this data could tell you and how you used the data to answer those questions)

## Challenges 
(discuss challenges you faced in the project)
The original state of the data presented challenges as it was often incomplete, not clean, and observed many discrepancies. It was a challenge to identify areas of issue and error as they were quite vast and extensive. 


## Future Goals
(what would you do if you had more time?)
Spend more time cleaning all of the data in greater depth and detail.
