# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
(fill in your description and goals here)
Focused on the learning that we have acheived throughout our time in the Data Science Flex course, this project brings together and tests SQL knowledge.


## Process
### Loaded CSV data into pgAdmin
- 5 unique CSV files had to be manually loaded into pgadmin
- loaded each column as text to avoid issues with data discrepancies 
### (your step 2)

## Results
(fill in what you discovered this data could tell you and how you used the data to answer those questions)
This data can provide a multitude of information to answer questions on things such as highest revenue of countries/cities, nderstanding the highest ordered products for countries/cities, 

This data could also answer other types of questions such as queries regarding stock levels and stock time and how long it would take to restock out of stock products.

## Challenges 
(discuss challenges you faced in the project)
The original state of the data presented challenges as it was often incomplete, not clean, and observed many discrepancies. It was a challenge to identify areas of issue and error as they were quite vast and extensive. 
Once in the data and working through data questions, it was clear that sometimes the incomplete data would create issues that would have to be resolved before being able to complete the work to answer the questions. 


## Future Goals
(what would you do if you had more time?)
Spend more time cleaning all of the data in greater depth and detail. Adding in additional queries throughout to reduce things like repetitive zeroes (e.g., Q1 of starting_with_questions).
